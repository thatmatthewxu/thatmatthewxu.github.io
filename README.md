# thatmatthewxu.github.io

This is the resume for [thatmatthewxu.github.io](thatmatthewxu.github.io) based on the jekyll template - [modern resume theme](https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme).

## Running locally

Before you start make sure you have Ruby and the gems for Jekyll installed locally. You can find out how to do that here.

Clone your resume repository locally (if you haven't already)

```shell
cd [your-repository-name]
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:4000`
Any changes you make will automatically build and you will be able to see these by refreshing your browser.

Note: You will need to re-run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to see changes made in `_config.yml`.
