  I'm a hands-on IT "nerd" based in Metro Vancouver now. I have totally over __15__ years of IT working experience in lots of different industries. 
  Additionally, I am a quick learner and have an outstanding, self-motivated professional with more than 5 years of IT working experience in 
  Vancouver, Canada, mostly focusing on <mark>Linux</mark> / <mark>Windows System Administrator</mark> / <mark>DevOps</mark> / <mark>Kubernetes Engineer</mark>.
  
  Currently, I'm working in a high-tech company as an IT manager, in charge of everything IT related. Identifying IT problems, resolving IT issues,
  helping the users to accomplish what they want, and planning IT strategy is my daily life. I pretty enjoy every moment of success achieved through 
  the efforts with the team and myself.
  
  Apart from the infrastructure, I also like developing various apps including both back-end and front-end by node js, python, etc. In my spare time, 
  I was fortunate enough to be part of a passionate, creative start-up team. Together, I participated in several interesting projects and not only 
  responsible for the infrastructure design and implementation part but also some of the code developing parts.
  
  I am always truly honor and proud of working with lots of excellent people in my life and learn from them. That makes me able to fit different 
  roles in the job.
